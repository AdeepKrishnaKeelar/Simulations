/*
Attendance System Simulation using C++
My friend Abhilash's project's simulation for my own fun.
Basically, he is building an application that helps to quicken
attendance-taking in classrooms by building an app where the
professor turns on for a few minutes and gives a key that the students
enter in their application and their details gets stored in the faculty's 
database or credentials or somewhere.
